            <h1>Quantifying a Lifetime of Snow</h1>
            <h2>
                How much snow does a Minneapolis-resident deal with in their lifetime?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yesterday (1/23/2018), Minneapolis woke up to the first major snowfall of the season with over 12 inches accumulating
                across the city. Snow emergencies quickly went into effect as residents scrambled to dig out their entrenched
                vehicles and move them to safety from tow trucks. The headaches caused by winter storms like this often leave residents
                wondering, "Why do I live here?".
            </p>
            <p>
                Using data available from the DNR, we can quantify how much snow, and headaches, 
                a Minneapolis resident has dealt with in their lifetime.
