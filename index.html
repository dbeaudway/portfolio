                            While working in the healthcare technology industry I was focused on guiding the development of web applications and implementing analytics tools.
                            During this time I discovered a passion for programming and creating applications that positively impact others. I'm currently finishing
                            a full stack software development program and looking to join a team building meaningful products.

                        translated to an online interactive dashboard that allows customers to easily engage with real estate
                        market data. Additionally, the administrative functionality of the website allows Cushman & Wakefield

                        The website application and email functionality were integreated with third-party tools, Google Analytics,
                        Google Tag Manager, and MailChimp to track the complete customer journey and support on-going communication.
